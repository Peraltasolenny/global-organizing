### New Business
-  [ ] @Mariatta : We want to evaluate if [Bevy](https://www.bevyhq.com/) will be suitable for PyLadies. They're keen on supporting dev communities and especially PyLadies. They're interested in providing service for PyLadies community.
    - Please share feedback if you have any pain points about Meetup [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTjhHL2wMTVjicmA14FbxUeRaU-TfG7I4Nkbkn88-pE/edit?usp=sharing). (login using pyladies account) It will help us evaluate the two services.
> The Bevy development team wants to start giving back to the greater dev community by providing dev-supported version of the service.  PyLadies, with its global leadership and many distributed chapters, might make a good fit.
