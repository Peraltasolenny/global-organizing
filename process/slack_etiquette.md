## :star2: Guidelines to help you get the most from our Slack community.:star2: 

All **PyLadies** spaces (online & physical) are governed by the **`PyLadies Code of Conduct`**.

You can read the Code of Conduct [here](https://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/).



###  :star2: Every Member of PyLadies is a _**person**_

This community is intended first & foremost for **any self-identifying PyLadies member**. While allies & friends of PyLadies may participate in the PyLadies Slack,  the PyLadies Slack is intended to be a community built _**for**_ and _**by**_ self-identifying PyLadies.

Additionally, the admins, moderators, & everyone else in PyLadies are **donating their spare time; nobody’s being paid.**  Our suggestions/answers may not always be correct, & you may not always get an answer. Treat us like somebody friendly you don’t know who’s standing next to you offering help or suggestions.



### :star2: PyLadies is asynchronous & international

We have members all around the world, and many of us are working professionals. As you are participating in conversations or seeking assistance, it’s entirely possible that you won’t get a response for an hour or day or more. 

With that in mind, use  `@here`, `@channel`, or `@everyone` _sparingly_, if at all (_these three slack commands send push notifications to all members in a channel or group **regardless of what time it is**_).  It’s very tempting to try to get more attention on your topic -- but remember that nobody is going to appreciate  lots of push notifications at 3am.

Be mindful when cross posting the same content in multiple channels. People in this community may not be super-chatty at any given moment, but we **are** reading posts across all channels.  Please also try to reduce channel "noise" by threading longer or more involved conversations, so that participants can more easily join your conversation & follow the prior comments.



### :star2: Some channels are more active than others
Questions in #general tend to get answered quickly, or they get pushed off the screen & forgotten. While sometimes members will revisit a conversation if it has gone offscreen it can be that when there's a lot of discussion/movement happening, you may want to re-post after a few days.

Conversely, if a channel is particularly quiet, please do not post "this channel is quiet".  Instead, try posting a question/article/or discussion point that others in the channel might comment on or enjoy.


### :star2: Messages in Slack cannot be deleted

We allow users to edit their messages for a short period of time after posting, ie to fix typos. But we keep messages as *proof*, for when people post inappropriate content.


### :star2: Don’t “ask to ask”
Newcomers very commonly ask about asking a question in one of a few ways:

<br>

_**“Does anyone know about [X tool or library]?”**_
The answer is probably **“yes,”** but nobody can help you until you state what your problem **is**. All too often by the time somebody asks what the **real** question is, the person who needed help has disconnected. _**Please be specific with your questions so all of us can help you even when you aren't online.**_ Share a code snippet, a link to where you're seeing the issue, a description of what is confusing you, and specifics on what you've tried so far.  More often than not, it also helps to paste your error logs into a snippet or text file  to accompany your question/issue.  

<br>

_**“Is it okay if I ask about [X tool or library] here?”**_
We have a dizzying array of channels, which we’re aware of and for which we apologize. All our channels are listed alphabetically. Browse the `Channels` list for any that seem like obvious places to ask your question. If you don’t see any topics or Channels that fit, don’t hesitate to post it in #general.  If there’s a better place for it, one of the moderators or other helpful members will suggest that, but don't worry - off topic messages aren’t going to get you banned.



### :star2: Be a model Slack citizen

Be the change you want to see in the world! Remember our community runs on volunteers & collaboration. If a conversation is getting heated, try to defuse it. If a hard question is unanswered, dig in & work through it with others. 



### :star2::star2: Thank you to everyone who's been following these rules already!!

This community is :earth_asia: international & distributed and it's nice to find that even with our diversity of backgrounds,  experience levels & nationalities, we have similar goals & can support one another. It's always a delight to be late-night coding & suddenly realize that halfway around the world, a cheerful collaborator is logging in to begin their day!
